<p> 
In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol.<div>
 Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games.<div>
 Part entertainment, brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. <div>
 The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch.<div>
 When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. <div>
 She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives.
